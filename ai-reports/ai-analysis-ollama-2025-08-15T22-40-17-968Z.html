                    <p>The test failed because it appears that the `expect(page).toHaveTitle(&#039;This title does not exist&#039;)` assertion timed out waiting for an element with the expected title. The test is intentionally failing to verify that the AI demo system correctly reports a title mismatch. Based on the stack trace, it seems that the test is expecting the page to have an element with a specific title, but the actual HTML content is different. To fix this issue, you should review the underlying HTML of the page being tested and update the `expect` assertion to match the actual expected title or ensure that the AI demo system correctly reports the title mismatch. One possible solution is to inspect the HTML content of the page using the browser&#039;s developer tools and verify that the element with the expected title does not exist. If it doesn&#039;t, you can update the test to use a different assertion or wait for a longer period to see if the element appears. Alternatively, if the element exists but has a different title, you may need to update the `expect` assertion to match the actual title. It&#039;s also worth noting that the &quot;flaky&quot; flag is set to false in this case, which means that the test was not marked as flaky due to its intermittent nature. However, it&#039;s still important to investigate and address any issues with the test to ensure its reliability. The test failed because it timed out waiting for an element with title &quot;This title does not exist&quot; on the page, but instead received an element with title &quot;Let&#039;s Shop&quot;. This suggests that the page content is not what was expected, possibly due to incorrect data or a misconfiguration in the application. To resolve this issue, you should verify that the page content matches the expected values. In this case, it seems like there was a typo or mismatch in the expected and actual title values. Check if the &quot;This title does not exist&quot; text is present on the actual page. If so, ensure that your test data or configuration settings are correct. It might also be helpful to verify the functionality of the application beyond just this one test case. Are there any other issues with the application&#039;s data or behavior? Are the titles consistently displayed as expected? The test failed because it&#039;s intentionally set up to fail by expecting a specific title (&quot;This title does not exist&quot;) but receiving a different one (&quot;Let&#039;s Shop&quot;). This is done for testing purposes to ensure the AI demo system correctly reports title mismatches. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps: 1. Review your test data and ensure that the expected and received titles match the actual content of the webpage. Double-check that no typos or formatting issues are causing discrepancies. 2. Verify that the `expect` function is properly configured to handle title mismatches. Make sure that the timeout value (5000ms in this case) is set correctly for your use case. 3. If possible, inspect the webpage&#039;s HTML structure and verify that it matches the expected format. This might help identify any issues with the webpage&#039;s rendering or content. By taking these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the test failure, allowing you to get back to testing your AI demo system successfully.</p>

                    <p>The test failed because it appears that the `expect(page).toHaveTitle(&#039;This title does not exist&#039;)` assertion timed out waiting for an element with the expected title. The test is intentionally failing to verify that the AI demo system correctly reports a title mismatch. Based on the stack trace, it seems that the test is expecting the page to have an element with a specific title, but the actual HTML content is different. To fix this issue, you should review the underlying HTML of the page being tested and update the `expect` assertion to match the actual expected title or ensure that the AI demo system correctly reports the title mismatch. One possible solution is to inspect the HTML content of the page using the browser&#039;s developer tools and verify that the element with the expected title does not exist. If it doesn&#039;t, you can update the test to use a different assertion or wait for a longer period to see if the element appears. Alternatively, if the element exists but has a different title, you may need to update the `expect` assertion to match the actual title. It&#039;s also worth noting that the &quot;flaky&quot; flag is set to false in this case, which means that the test was not marked as flaky due to its intermittent nature. However, it&#039;s still important to investigate and address any issues with the test to ensure its reliability. The test failed because it timed out waiting for an element with title &quot;This title does not exist&quot; on the page, but instead received an element with title &quot;Let&#039;s Shop&quot;. This suggests that the page content is not what was expected, possibly due to incorrect data or a misconfiguration in the application. To resolve this issue, you should verify that the page content matches the expected values. In this case, it seems like there was a typo or mismatch in the expected and actual title values. Check if the &quot;This title does not exist&quot; text is present on the actual page. If so, ensure that your test data or configuration settings are correct. It might also be helpful to verify the functionality of the application beyond just this one test case. Are there any other issues with the application&#039;s data or behavior? Are the titles consistently displayed as expected? The test failed because it&#039;s intentionally set up to fail by expecting a specific title (&quot;This title does not exist&quot;) but receiving a different one (&quot;Let&#039;s Shop&quot;). This is done for testing purposes to ensure the AI demo system correctly reports title mismatches. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps: 1. Review your test data and ensure that the expected and received titles match the actual content of the webpage. Double-check that no typos or formatting issues are causing discrepancies. 2. Verify that the `expect` function is properly configured to handle title mismatches. Make sure that the timeout value (5000ms in this case) is set correctly for your use case. 3. If possible, inspect the webpage&#039;s HTML structure and verify that it matches the expected format. This might help identify any issues with the webpage&#039;s rendering or content. By taking these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the test failure, allowing you to get back to testing your AI demo system successfully.</p>
