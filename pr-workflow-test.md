# ✅ Repository Cleanup - SDET/QA Engineer References Removed

## Test Objectives

```sh
**Created**: July 12, 2025
**Author**:   jonathan
**Purpose**: Verify GitHub repository rules and PR workflow configuration
🧪 Pull Request Workflow Test
```

*This test demonstrates our enterprise-grade GitHub workflow configuration is properly protecting the main branch and enforcing code quality standards.*

---

**Recommendation**: Adjust repository rules to match actual workflow outputs.

The repository has **5 required status checks** but the workflow may not provide all 5.

### 🚨 Issue Identified

- ✅ PR workflow enforced
- ✅ Feature branch creation works
- ❌ Direct push to `main` blocked (as expected)
   ✅ **SUCCESS**: Repository rules are working!

### 📋 Test Results

- **Branch Protection**: Preventing direct main pushes ✅
- **PR Template**: Professional template created
- **CODEOWNERS**: Auto-assignment setup
- **Required Status Checks**: Configured but need adjustment
- **Repository Rules**: Applied to `main` branch

### 🔧 Configuration Verified

1. ✅ **Repository Rules**: Should enforce quality standards
2. ✅ **Status Checks**: GitHub Actions should run automatically
3. ✅ **CODEOWNERS**: Should automatically assign reviewers
4. ✅ **PR Template**: Should appear when creating pull requests
5. ✅ **Branch Protection**: Direct pushes to `main` should be blocked

### ✅ Expected Behavior

This test file validates that our enterprise-grade GitHub collaboration setup works correctly:
