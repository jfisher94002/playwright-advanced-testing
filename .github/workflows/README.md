## üîó Related Documentation

5. **Documentation:** Keep this README updated with changes
6. **Error Handling:** Use `continue-on-error` strategically
7. **Artifact Organization:** Consistent naming and retention policies
8. **Timeout Settings:** Set appropriate timeouts for different test types
9. **Naming Convention:** Use descriptive workflow and job names with emojis

## üìà Best Practices

- `@e2e` - End-to-end scenarios
- `@performance` - Performance benchmarks
- `@critical` - Critical path tests
- `@regression` - Full regression suite
- `@smoke` - Quick validation tests
   Use test annotations for workflow filtering:

### Test Categories

- Repository secrets for sensitive data
- `playwright.config.ts` - Test configuration per environment
- `environment-testing.yml` - Environment URLs and settings
   Update environment-specific variables in:

### Environment Configuration

4. Add documentation to this README
5. Include appropriate artifact uploads
6. Follow existing patterns for consistency
7. Create new `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/`

### Adding New Workflows

## üõ† Customization

- **Artifact Links:** Direct access to reports and screenshots
- **Result Comments:** Detailed test results in PR comments
- **Status Checks:** Required status checks for PR merging

### PR Integration

- **Security Alerts:** Issues for vulnerability discoveries
- **Dependency Updates:** Weekly issues for outdated packages
- **Test Failures:** Automatic issues for nightly test failures

### Issue Creation

## üîç Monitoring and Notifications

4. Release notes are enhanced with test results
5. Documentation is updated automatically
6. Release workflow automatically validates the build
7. Create release tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`

### Release Process

- **Performance Tests:** Included in nightly comprehensive runs
- **Dependency Check:** Weekly dependency analysis on Mondays
- **Nightly Tests:** Comprehensive testing at 2 AM UTC

### Scheduled Operations

```md
  -f browsers=chromium
  -f test_type=smoke \
  -f environment=staging \
gh workflow run environment-testing.yml \
# Trigger environment testing workflow
```yaml
